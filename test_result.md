# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## metadata:
##   created_by: "main_agent"

##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Saves to MongoDB contact_messages collection. Returns success message in Slovak. Also implemented GET /api/contact for retrieving all messages."

        comment: "COMPREHENSIVE BACKEND TESTING COMPLETED - All 8 test scenarios passed: ✅ Valid submission with phone (+421XXXXXXXXX format), ✅ Valid submission without phone, ✅ Missing name validation (422 error), ✅ Invalid email validation (422 error), ✅ Short message validation (<10 chars, 422 error), ✅ Long message validation (>1000 chars, 422 error), ✅ Invalid phone validation (422 error with Slovak error message), ✅ GET /api/contact endpoint returns list of messages. Additional testing confirmed alternative phone format (0XXXXXXXXX) works correctly. MongoDB persistence verified - messages are being saved and retrieved properly. API responses include correct Slovak success messages and proper UUID generation."

        comment: "COMPREHENSIVE FRONTEND TESTING COMPLETED - CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND: Toast notification system is not working. Backend integration is functional (API calls successful: 200 for valid data, 422 for validation errors), form validation works (HTML5 validation visible), form clears after submission, but Sonner toast notifications are not rendering in DOM. All other functionality works: ✅ Navigation links (O nás, Služby, Prepravný poriadok, Kontakt), ✅ Accordion expand/collapse, ✅ Responsive design on mobile (375x667), ✅ Form fields accessible and functional, ✅ Backend API integration, ✅ Form clearing after submission. ISSUE: Toaster component from Sonner library not rendering despite being imported in App.js. Attempted fixes: removed next-themes dependency, simplified Toaster configuration, created missing utils.js file. Root cause appears to be Sonner library compatibility issue with current React setup."
